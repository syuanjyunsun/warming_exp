The data and code used for this study are available in the main folder of # warming_exp on this repository.

The dataset contains life history traits for both pre-hatching and post-hatching parental care behaviour in burying beetles, when beetles were exposed to three different experimental temperature treatments (control, +2C, and +4C).
The study was conducted in National Taiwan University in 2024. The data were analysed using R (version 4.1.2).

Explanations:
carc wt: carcass mass in gram	
male: male family origin 	
female: female family origin 		
tr: temperature treatment	
ball_success: whether carcass was converted to a ball	
hatching_success: whether eggs successfully hatched	
success: whether there was at least one surviving larva to dispersal	
broodsize: number of dispersing larvae	
broodmass: total brood mass	
clutchsize: total number of eggs	
avgmass: averaged larval mass (broodmass divided by broodsize)	
dispersal_time: date of larval dispersal	
ball: time to caracss ball formation		
larva: time to presence of larva		
egg: time to egg presence		
dispersal: time to larval dispersal
